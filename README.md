<!--Used to Summarize Project for General Public -->
This is a pretty simple app, that I mostly built for fun, the guts of it are based on another project of mine, https://github.com/kravenoff42/realm-builder, that was built with a friend of mine, danielv6987. 

We worked pretty hard on it and I think it turned out pretty cool.
